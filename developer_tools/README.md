# Devtools
In this folder, we'll be learning how to use the browser's DevTools! (I'm using FireFox)

Using this site: https://dev-tools.hbtn.info/
And the [FireFox DevTools](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/)

Each exercise's answer may be stored in a file starting with the same number.

0. Changing the devide viewport to mobile
    Press the little phone and tablet icon in the corner
1. Changing the background color of the ``body`` tag
    Press the ``body`` tag in the HTML, then go down to its CSS and change the value in ``background-color: #HERE;``
2. Change the cake's ``:hover`` state
    Go to the element, select its HTML tag, then press on the very tiny ``:hov`` just below the HTML section, and check the ``:hover`` checkbox
3. The CSS for the button
    located at the bottom of the inspect tab
4. Change button styles in the DevTools
    Select the elements with the color you want to change, by right-clicking on the element then choosing inspect, find its CSS selector at the bottom of the inspect tab, then change its color there. <strong>This could affect all of the butons with the same CSS selector!!!</strong>
5. Remove cake button
    Right-click on the cake, select inspect, right-click on its HTML tag at the top of the inspect tab, then select ``delete node``.
6. Where is the ``margin-bottom`` style of the "About" header defined?
    Inspect the "About" element, go to "Computed" at the bottom right of the inspect tab, find its ``margin-bottom`` property, and click in the CSS file link.
7. How many click event listeners are referenced in JavaScript files?
    ``Right click > inspect`` anything in the site, go to ``Debugger`` at the top, then find the .click AJAX events in the JS files.
