# Recreating a static HTML + CSS website from a Figma File

Figma file: https://www.figma.com/file/XrEAsu1vQj5fhVaNG38d2W/Homepage?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design

This repository consists of two propjects.

The first one is inside [html_advanced/](html_advanced/), which is an HTML-only version of the complete site.

The second one is inside [css_advanced/](css_advanced/), which is a nearly-complete version of the website.
