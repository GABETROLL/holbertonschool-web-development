# Recreating a Website from a Figma File - HTML only
In this project, we'll try to make a **static** webpage using [this Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/XrEAsu1vQj5fhVaNG38d2W/Homepage?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design).

First, in this folder (``html_advanved/``), we'll make an HTML skeleton of that webpage. Then, in ``project root/css_advanced/``, we'll add CSS to it.

Holberton has provided us with very specific guides to make the webpage. Here's 2 example images they provided us:
## HTML structure
<img src="README_images/HTML_structure_guide.jpg" alt="Rectangle box outlines with words. Describe the (mostly accurate) webpage structure.">

## Final product
<img src="README_images/final_product_goal.jpg" alt="How the final product, after applying the CSS, which should happen in ../css_advanced/ in this repository.">
